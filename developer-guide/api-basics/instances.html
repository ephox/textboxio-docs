<p>Access the current or last active editor using <code><a href="19760393.html">textboxio.getActiveEditor()</a></code>. The <em>active </em>editor is the editor that was most recently focused by a user. If no editor has been focused, then the first editor on the page is returned.</p>

<p>Textbox.io remembers the selector that was used to create each editor. A developer may retrieve editor instances by passing that selector to <code><a href="19760391.html">textboxio.get()</a></code>. Note, that this method returns an array of editors.</p>
